## Installation
-----------------

Any updates on the Android SDK will require re-building by performing `gradlew assemble` on the Android SDK. This will create an `AAR` within the `build\outputs\aar` directory for each `Build Type`. For the Demo Application to get updated with the latest changed from the SDK, simply copy any of the `AAR`'s in the mentioned directory and paste it in `app\libs` within the Demo Application.
