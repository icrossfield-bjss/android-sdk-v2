Mobile Connect SDK
------------------
This demo project has been built with Android Studio, it can be built by importing it into Android Studio and
running "gradle build".

The Android SDK is included as an Android Archive Module (AAR)

Customising the Demo App
------------------------
This demo app is configured out of the box to use a set of demonstration application credentials. You will need to replace
these with application credentials created using the GSMA Mobile Connect developer portal (developer.mobileconnect.io)

The following changes need to be made

1/ In the file app/src/main/assets/demo.properties
   - Replace config.applicationURL with the 'Redirect URL' that you will be registering on the GSMA Mobile Connect developer 
     when you provision your application.
   - Replace (only if you want) config.discoveryRedirectURL with a URL that will be used at the end of the discovery process. 
     Note generally what is in this URL is not important so unless you really want to it's recommended to leave this as is.

2/ In the file app/src/main/java/com.gsma.android/xoperatorapidemo/discovery/DiscoveryDeveloperOperatorSettings.java you 
   will see there are two sets of application credentials provisioned. These should be replaced with credentials issued
   by the GSMA Mobile Connect developer portal when you provision your application
   - You will see two sets of 'settings' are coded allowing you to put in both production and development mode credentials.
     These will be displayed when you run the demo app. Initially you should just replace the development mode credentials with
     your own (issued from the developer portal) and comment out the production ones, or use the sandbox details from the dev
     portal.
   - Make sure to have the correct URL for the Discovery Service, and the Client Key and Secret issued by the dev portal 
     to replace the details that are already hard coded
   - You can change the name of the settings to suit your own requirements, this is simply displayed in the demo app
